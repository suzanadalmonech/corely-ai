# Corely | Clarity Engine 💎

Corely is a high-performance content distillation tool built to transform information overload into actionable clarity. It uses a custom-built "Clarity Engine" to process raw data and extract the **6 essential pillars** of any subject.

## 🚀 The Core Vision
The internet is full of noise. Corely was designed for the modern learner who needs the "distilled essence" of a topic. Using the rule of 6, it forces cognitive focus and maximizes information retention.

## ✨ Features & UI
- **Glassmorphism Interface:** A clean, modern UI built with Tailwind CSS for a distraction-free experience.
- **Multimodal Ready:** Architected to handle universal inputs (text, links, and file attachments).
- **Sequential Insight Delivery:** Results are animated progressively to ensure the user absorbs each point.
- **Cognitive Optimization:** Specifically tuned to provide exactly 6 points, preventing "analysis paralysis."

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS (Custom Glassmorphism styles).
- **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Processing:** Designed for Google Gemini API integration for multimodal analysis.

## 📂 Architecture Overview
The project is structured into two main components:
1. **The Input Source (Glass Left):** A universal container for raw data input.
2. **The Distilled Essence (Glass Right):** A processing unit that filters noise and renders sequential insights.

## 📖 How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Paste a complex text or attach a file.
4. Click **"Distill Now"** to see the magic happen.
